# Introduction

Since 2015, I have taught high-school and university students, accumulating over 2500 hours of tutoring to roughly 200 students. 
The subjects covered have included:
1. Physics:
    1. Mechanics;
    1. Electromagnetism;
    1. Thermodynamics;
    1. Quantum Mechanics;
1. Maths:
    1. Geometry;
    1. Algebra;
    1. Calculus 1;
    1. Linear Algebra;
    1. Statistics;
    1. Probability.
       
Whenever applicable, the subjects were taught both at high-school and university level.

The objective of this repo is two-fold. The main aim is to help students, who will be able to find a free, comprehensive collection of solved exercises, that includes drawings to make the physical situation clearer, and detailed explanations on why each step is performed.

On the other hand, as the number of subjects touched increases, I find it most helpful to write down a list of interesting and highly educational exercises: this forces me to be precise and keeps me on my toes!

I encourage whoever goes through these exercises to let me know if and how I can improve this collection, with the hope that they can find them useful.
