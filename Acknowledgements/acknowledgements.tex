\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank all the students that, over the years, have provided me with a generous amount of problem sheets, other than their wits and insights on how to solve them. A special thank you also goes to Paolo Sellitto, who many, many years ago gave me the possibility to teach Physics and Mathematics to a large variety of students.
