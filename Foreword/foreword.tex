\chapter*{Foreword}
\label{ch: foreword}
I am starting to write this collection of problems with relative solutions because, after many years of tutoring students, I have decided that it is time to leave something tangible for other students to come. I am not entirely sure on whether I have the capability nor the right experience to realize such a task -- I will do my best, hoping that someone might find these notes useful for their studies.
